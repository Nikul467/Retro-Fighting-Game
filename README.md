# Iron Fist


This game is built with a minimal use of external libraries, relying primarily on core Python concepts and the SimpleGUI module for rendering graphics and handling user input.

My role was to implement spatial partitioning techniques, such as grid-based partitioning, to optimize the collision detection process.
