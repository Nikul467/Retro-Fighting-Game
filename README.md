# Iron Fist


This game is built with a minimal use of external libraries, relying primarily on core Python concepts and the SimpleGUI module for rendering graphics and handling user input.
The game focuses on efficient collision detection using hitboxes and hurtboxes, frame-based sprite animations, and physics for movement, all manually implemented without heavy dependency on game engines or pre-built systems.
